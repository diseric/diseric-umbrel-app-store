  qBittorrent is a free and open-source BitTorrent client.
  This package automatically routes all of qBittorrent's traffic through a

  security by hiding your IP address.
  You must configure your VPN provider in the settings before starting the app.
  Supports many providers like PIA, NordVPN, Mullvad, and more.
