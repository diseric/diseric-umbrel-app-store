description: >-
  DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 
  and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, 
  DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most 
  decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.

  This app runs a full DigiByte node, contributing to the network's 
  decentralization and security. The node will download and validate 
  the entire blockchain (~50GB) and participate in the peer-to-peer network.

  Features:
  • Full blockchain validation and storage
  • P2P networking to support the DigiByte network
  • RPC interface for advanced users and developers  
  • Transaction indexing for complete functionality
  • Built-in wallet functionality (optional)
  • Real-time blockchain synchronization
