  DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 
  and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, 
  DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most 
  decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence with one of the most active 
  communities in the crypto and blockchain space.
